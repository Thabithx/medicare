high-performance medical ecosystem built to transform the way hospitals operate. It is designed to handle the high-stakes environment of a modern hospital with the elegance of a modern desktop OS.

--The Smart UI Engine: I bypassed the standard Java Swing look and wrote custom 2D drawing logic. 
--Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Secure Session Management: Each actor gets only what they need to see.
---Time Analytics: Built-in reporting that calculates doctor efficiency and hospital revenue on the fly. I optimized the SQL layer to handle complex data relationships without a millisecond of lag.

--Medical Command Center: Track clinical performance and financial health from one unified dashboard.
--Doctor’s Clinical Suite: A radical new way for doctors to manage schedules, approve appointments, and access full patient histories in a single click.
--Notifications: A centralized alert system that ensures not a single patient is ever overlooked.
--The Patient Profile: A deep medical ledger tracking allergies, chronic conditions, and history—presented beautifully.
